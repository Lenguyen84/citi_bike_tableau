CITI BIKE VISUALIZATIONS & ANALYSIS

This project involves generating reports and analyses for city officials to support the growth of New York City's Citi Bike program. Utilizing over a decade of bike usage data available on their System Data website (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data), I have created visualizations, interactive dashboards, and a comprehensive story in Tableau, along with detailed documentation of my data analysis.

I worked with 2023 monthly data from Jersey City, New Jersey, which also includes data from outside the state (e.g., stations in Manhattan where bikes were returned). I combined all twelve months of Jersey City data into a single file for analysis and visualization. Due to GitHub's space limitations, I couldn't upload the cleaned file; however, all twelve individual .csv files are available in the "Data" folder.
 
My visualizations overral story are posted at: (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/le.nguyen1734/viz/Citi_bike_LeNguyen/OveralsStory?publish=yes)  on Tableau Public

and Le_citibike.twb and Tableau Public workbook files are in the Tableau Folder

Overral Story is included :
1.  First story: Rider Distribution in Jersey City: From Start Stations to End Stations – Total Rides: 31,773 -Total Rides 31,773
2.  Second Story is a combination of 3 worksheets, giving us a visualization of:
    -   Tuesday is the longest rental (Behavior change sheet) 
    -   Riders are definitely augmenting Wednesday Rentals - Especially for Classic_Bike (Weekday Rideable Types)
    -   August is the hottest month of biking (Montly Rideable Types)
3.  Third Story - Most of riders started their trip around 5-6 pm (Count of Riders by Months and Hours)
4.  Fourth Sotry: visualizing the  particiaption of riders for each Station, sorted by the highest to the lowest of Ride ID count - Grove St PATH station had the highest of participants.
5.  Fifth Story - Comparison of Casuals and Members by the average of Rental duration


There are numerous reasons to support the success of the Citi Bike program, including reducing car traffic, minimizing noise and air pollution, and promoting health and exercise, among others.

While my analysis focuses solely on 2023, the insights gained could be relevant to other years and the past decade. I trust you are always exploring new strategies to ensure the program's continued growth and sustainability.

Based on the visualizations, dashboards, and story presented, adjustments such as reallocating bikes at specific locations, ensuring the availability of certain bike types to targeted riders at particular times, and placing greater emphasis on stations near transportation hubs, parks, and sightseeing areas could help boost ridership and enhance public perception of the program’s benefits.

Analyzing rider behavior, including the types of bikes used at starting and ending stations, can provide valuable insights for optimizing resource deployment, determining whether to add new stations or adjust the size of existing ones, and fine-tuning the bike mix at each station. While this analysis addresses some initial questions, further in-depth exploration could be useful in informing future strategic decisions.
